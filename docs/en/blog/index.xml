      <description>Distributed Tracing What is Distributed Tracing？ Distributed tracing, also known as distributed request tracking, is a methodology for analyzing and monitoring distributed service profiles, especially for failures that occur for unknown and degraded performance reasons.&#xA;Core concepts traceId:Identifies a unique ID generated by a single user request spanId:Identifies the position of this call in the call chain Why Distributed Tracking is Needed？ With the growth of business volume, monolithic services have been unable to meet the demand, so SOA servitization and microservices, and multiple instances of each service are deployed, resulting in increased difficulty in troubleshooting and performance issues.</description>
